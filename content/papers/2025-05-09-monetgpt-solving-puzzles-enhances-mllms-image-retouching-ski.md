## Key Contributions

- **Operation-Aware MLLM for Procedural Image Retouching**: This paper presents **MonetGPT**, the first framework to fine-tune multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to understand and plan procedural image retouching operations with precise parameter estimation. Unlike generative editing methods that regenerate pixels (causing identity loss), MonetGPT works with a curated library of 33 pre-defined procedural operations organized in three stages (lighting, color/temperature, color-specific adjustments). This preserves object identity, resolution, and provides full user control through interpretable, non-destructive edits compatible with high-resolution 16-bit images.

- **Visual Puzzle-Based Skill Learning Strategy**: The paper introduces a novel training approach that teaches MLLMs image operation awareness through three specially-designed visual puzzles rather than direct supervised learning on paired data. Puzzle A teaches individual operation effects (given before/after images, predict the operation and value), Puzzle B teaches aesthetic judgment and optimal parameter ranges, and Puzzle C teaches comprehensive editing plan generation. This design addresses the MLLM's fundamental lack of understanding about what image operations do, enabling learning from limited expert data (~7k samples for Puzzle A, ~5k for Puzzle B, ~13k for Puzzle C).

- **Reasoning-Grounded Dataset Synthesis**: To leverage puzzle-based learning, the authors synthesize reasoning explanations by grounding a pre-trained LLM (Gemini 2.0 Flash) on actual visual adjustments rather than allowing hallucination. For each puzzle instance, the model generates structured reasoning in the form of <Adjustment, Issue, Solution> triplets that explain how each operation addresses specific visual problems. This reasoning serves as both training signal and inference pathway—during inference, the MLLM first generates high-level reasoning about image issues, then uses this reasoning to regress precise parameter values, effectively using reasoning as a bridge from intent to numerical adjustments.

- **Staged Procedural Pipeline with User Interactivity**: MonetGPT applies edits in three stages (lighting → color adjustments → color-specific fine-tuning), enabling multiple advantages: (1) invertibility of operations within categories to synthesize training data reliably, (2) reduced complexity compared to simultaneous multi-operation planning, (3) clearer reasoning about which operation causes which visual effect. Critically, the autoregressive nature of MLLMs enables users to edit and override the plan at any stage, with subsequent stages automatically adapting—users can modify any proposed adjustment and have the system re-plan downstream operations accordingly.

- **Comprehensive Evaluation Against Generative and Procedural Baselines**: The paper provides extensive evaluation comparing against: RL-based methods (Exposure), generative approaches (MGIE, InstructPix2Pix), unpaired enhancement methods, direct MLLM regression variants, Gemini 2.0 with chain-of-thought, and commercial software (Google Photos). Evaluation includes quantitative metrics (SSIM, LPIPS, PSNR, histogram intersection on 400 Adobe5k images), qualitative user studies with both novice (n=15) and expert (n=10) raters, and ablation studies demonstrating the necessity of puzzle-based training versus direct regression.

- **Practical Library Implementation with Simplified Parameter Space**: Rather than using existing complicated tools like GIMP, the authors developed a Python library with 33 modular adjustment operations where each operation is controlled by a single master parameter (with sub-parameters either fixed or derived). Operations follow a perceptually linear [-100, +100] scale, enabling the fine-tuned MLLM to generate JSON-format edit plans that directly execute without additional coding, making the approach practical for end-users while maintaining interpretability.

## Core Insights

- **MLLMs Lack Operational Understanding Without Explicit Training**: The paper demonstrates a critical insight that pre-trained MLLMs, despite their strong visual understanding, have fundamentally poor internal models of what image operations do and how they affect images. Direct fine-tuning on paired retouching data (the "MLLM Regression" baseline) fails significantly because the model cannot connect visual changes to specific operations. This explains why naïve approaches like prompting Gemini 2.0 with a library of operations perform poorly. The solution—training on visual puzzles that explicitly teach operation semantics—reveals that operation-awareness is a learnable skill that transfers to accurate planning.

- **Reasoning as a Pathway for Parameter Regression**: Rather than directly regressing numerical parameters from images (which causes overfitting with limited data), MonetGPT uses chain-of-thought reasoning as an intermediate representation that bridges high-level image analysis to precise parameter values. During inference, the model first generates semantic descriptions of problems and solutions, then translates these into numerical adjustments. This two-stage process (reasoning → regression) significantly outperforms direct regression baselines, suggesting that LLMs are better suited to semantic reasoning about editing intent than numerical regression from visual features.

- **Invertibility Enables Synthetic Data Generation at Scale**: By restricting modifications within parameter categories that remain invertible (e.g., modifying only lighting operations, then only color operations), the authors can procedurally generate training puzzles from expert-edited images without requiring paired source-target data. They sample an expert-edited image 𝐼𝑋, apply random operation perturbations to create degraded versions 𝐼𝑆, then use grounded reasoning generation to label why each operation helps restore quality. This unpaired approach is critical—the dataset is synthesized entirely from expert edits without ever seeing the original source images during training, yet generalizes to unseen sources.

- **Staged Planning Reduces State Space and Improves Reasoning Quality**: Breaking the planning task into three stages (lighting → color/temperature → color-specific) rather than jointly predicting all operations dramatically simplifies the problem. Figure 7 demonstrates that direct regression produces nearly identical parameter values across different input conditions, while staged MonetGPT produces appropriately varied adjustments. This staging enables clearer causal reasoning about which operations address which visual issues—humans cannot easily explain why 15 simultaneous operations are needed, but can clearly articulate why blacks need lifting and highlights need reduction in specific lighting scenarios.

- **Operation-Awareness Transfers to Diverse Aesthetic Preferences**: Figure 7 (right panel) shows that the same operation-aware MLLM can generate different editing plans based on style tags ("retro," "balanced," "vibrant") by simply conditioning the prompt differently. This flexibility would be impossible with fixed parameter regression. The underlying operation understanding allows the model to adapt its adjustments based on stylistic intent, suggesting that teaching machines about operation semantics unlocks greater adaptability than teaching specific editing patterns.

- **Identity Preservation and Explainability Align with User Preferences**: User studies show strong preference for MonetGPT (preferred by 60-70% of both novice and expert users vs. Exposure or MGIE), and this preference correlates with identity preservation and explainability. Experts appreciated the interpretable nature of adjustments and could suggest minor refinements like "increase skin tone saturation," indicating they understand and can override the system. In contrast, generative methods that preserve or improve metrics may still fail user preferences due to identity loss, highlighting that procedural approaches better serve professional workflows despite slightly lower PSNR values.

## Key Data & Results

| Method | SSIM ↑ | LPIPS ↓ | PSNR ↑ | Histogram ↑ |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| Exposure [Hu et al. 2018] | 0.63 | 0.14 | 15.12 | 47.21 |
| Unpaired [Kosugi et al. 2020] | 0.83 | 0.12 | 21.73 | 83.98 |
| RSFNet [Ouyang et al. 2023] | 0.88 | 0.08 | 21.85 | 80.26 |
| InstructPix2Pix [Brooks et al. 2023] | 0.61 | 0.22 | 16.99 | 73.90 |
| MGIE [Fu et al. 2024] | 0.74 | 0.08 | 22.94 | 79.95 |
| Gemini CoT + Library | 0.80 | 0.14 | 17.83 | 63.71 |
| GooglePhotos | 0.90 | 0.06 | 25.86 | 86.47 |
| MLLM Regression | 0.84 | 0.10 | 20.89 | 82.05 |
| **MonetGPT (ours)** | **0.90** | **0.07** | **23.75** | **79.50** |

**Dataset & Evaluation Setup**: Trained on PPR10K (expert A only, unpaired setup with synthetic puzzles), tested on 400 images from Adobe5k for generalization. Metrics include perceptual similarity (SSIM, LPIPS), pixel fidelity (PSNR), and histogram intersection across contrast/luminance/saturation. User study on 50 Adobe5k and Reddit images with 15 novice and 10 expert raters (200 binary preference questions).

- **Quantitative Performance**: MonetGPT achieves competitive or leading performance on most metrics—tied with GooglePhotos on SSIM (0.90), comparable LPIPS (0.07 vs. 0.06), exceeding most open-source baselines on PSNR (23.75). The histogram metric (79.50) indicates good distribution matching, though slightly below GooglePhotos (86.47) and Unpaired (83.98). On LPIPS, MonetGPT (0.07) matches the best performer (RSFNet 0.08, MGIE 0.08) while using an interpretable procedural approach rather than end-to-end generation.

- **User Preference Strong Across Expertise Levels**: In head-to-head comparisons, MonetGPT was preferred by approximately 65-70% of both novice and expert users against Exposure and MGIE baselines. Figure 8 clearly demonstrates consistent preference across user groups, with experts providing constructive feedback (e.g., "increase skin saturation," "better curve emphasis") that indicates they understand and trust the proposed adjustments. This preference gap is notable because it contradicts purely metric-based ranking—methods with higher PSNR (GooglePhotos 25.86 vs. MonetGPT 23.75) were not consistently preferred in user studies.

- **Ablation: Direct Regression Severely Underperforms**: The MLLM Regression baseline (same model, architecture, training data but trained to directly predict parameters) achieves SSIM 0.84, LPIPS 0.10, PSNR 20.89—substantially below MonetGPT on SSIM (0.90) and PSNR. Figure 10 shows that the regression baseline suffers from severe overfitting: it predicts nearly identical parameter values across 100 different images, failing to capture the full range of adjustments. In contrast, MonetGPT's violin plots show it appropriately uses the full parameter range [-100, +100], confirming that reasoning-based planning enables greater diversity and adaptability.

- **Computational Efficiency Trade-offs**: Full staged pipeline inference requires ~25 seconds on RTX 4090, compared to ~10 seconds for direct regression and ~2 seconds for Exposure. While slower than RL-based methods, this is acceptable for post-processing workflows. Training takes ~8 hours on H100 GPU for puzzle-based fine-tuning vs. 2.5 hours for regression, representing a 3.2× increase. The cost is justified by substantially better generalization and identity preservation compared to alternatives.

- **Generalization to Out-of-Domain Images**: Training only on PPR10K (mostly portraits) but evaluating on diverse Adobe5k images shows reasonable generalization. The histogram intersection metric (79.50) indicates the predicted distributions roughly match expert targets despite domain shift. However, comparison against GooglePhotos on the same evaluation setup suggests room for improvement—GooglePhotos likely leverages larger training datasets that MonetGPT was explicitly constrained to avoid dependence on massive proprietary data.

## Strengths

- **Novel and Well-Motivated Problem Formulation**: The paper addresses a genuine gap between powerful generative editing (which loses identity) and traditional procedural editing (which is difficult to plan). The framing of procedural image retouching as an MLLM reasoning task is novel, and the observation that MLLMs lack operational understanding is insightful and well-evidenced. The approach is grounded in human learning theory (skill learning through puzzle-solving), lending credibility to the design choices. The problem has clear practical value for professional workflows where editability and interpretability are non-negotiable.

- **Innovative Training Strategy via Visual Puzzles**: The three-puzzle framework is creative and well-designed. Rather than forcing the model to learn from limited paired data, the authors cleverly decompose learning into semantic units: understanding individual operations (Puzzle A), aesthetic judgment (Puzzle B), and planning (Puzzle C). The progression is pedagogically sound, and the use of grounded reasoning generation to prevent hallucination is technically sophisticated. This approach is generalizable to other domains requiring operation understanding and could influence future work on skill learning in multimodal models.

- **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation**: The paper compares against diverse baselines spanning RL-based (Exposure), neural regression (RSFNet), generative (MGIE, InstructPix2Pix), and commercial solutions (GooglePhotos). Evaluation includes multiple dimensions: quantitative metrics (SSIM, LPIPS, PSNR, histogram), user studies with both experts and novices, ablations demonstrating necessity of puzzle-based training, and qualitative analysis with expert feedback. The supplementary material appears extensive (referenced repeatedly). User studies with 25 total raters is reasonable for this domain.

- **Practical Implementation and Reproducibility**: The authors promise to release code, data, models, and supplementary results. The paper provides sufficient implementation details: Qwen-VL-7B fine-tuned with DoRA adapters, specific hyperparameters (learning rate 1e-4, rank 256, single epoch), dataset sizes (7k, 5k, 13k samples), and library specifications (33 operations). The decision to develop a simplified Python library rather than relying on GIMP shows attention to practical deployment. The JSON-based output format makes integration straightforward.

- **Explainability and User Control**: Unlike black-box generative methods, MonetGPT provides human-readable reasoning for each adjustment and enables per-stage editing. Figure 9 demonstrates autoregressive editing where users can modify proposed plans at any stage and have the system re-plan downstream operations—this is a significant usability advantage. The <Adjustment, Issue, Solution> structured reasoning format is interpretable and actionable, enabling domain experts to verify and refine suggestions.

- **Thoughtful Design Choices with Clear Justification**: The staged pipeline design (Section 4.3) is justified by three considerations: invertibility for data synthesis, reduced complexity, and clearer reasoning. The choice of Qwen-VL over potentially larger models, the quantization of parameters to [-100, +100] for easier tokenization, and the structure of the reasoning dataset all show careful consideration. The paper explains not just WHAT they did but WHY, which aids reproducibility and future work.

## Weaknesses

- **Limited Training Data Diversity and Potential Domain Shift**: The model is trained on only PPR10K expert A with ~25k synthesized puzzle samples total, then evaluated on Adobe5k. PPR10K is predominantly portrait images, while Adobe5k contains more diverse scenes. While the paper claims generalization, quantitative results reveal the gap: histogram intersection (79.50) is notably lower than GooglePhotos (86.47) and several baselines. The paper does not provide cross-domain ablations (e.g., training on both PPR10K experts, evaluating on PPR10K-held-out) to isolate the impact of domain shift vs. the method itself. The strong performance of GooglePhotos suggests that larger, more diverse training data may be critical, but this limitation is not deeply analyzed.

- **Unclear Puzzle Generation and Potential Data Leakage**: The paper states puzzles are generated "synthetically" by applying random operations to expert images, but critical details are missing. How are operation parameters sampled? What is the distribution? For Puzzle B, the paper assumes "any sufficiently large adjustment made to 𝐼𝑋 degrades the image"—this is a strong assumption not validated. How are the four perturbation levels chosen in Puzzle B? Is there a principled distribution, or is it ad-hoc? The test images come from a different dataset (Adobe5k vs. PPR10K), but potential data leakage through the synthetic puzzles generated from expert images is not discussed. If Adobe5k was used to generate puzzles, results would be inflated.

- **Insufficient Analysis of Failure Cases and Limitations**: The paper presents mostly successful examples but provides limited discussion of when and why the method fails. Figure 6 shows qualitative comparisons but doesn't highlight failure modes. What types of images does MonetGPT struggle with? The paper mentions experts suggested "minor refinements" but doesn't quantify how often these were needed or how significant they were. The inference time (25 sec) is substantially slower than Exposure (2 sec)—for professional workflows, is this acceptable? The paper doesn't discuss this trade-off. Additionally, the method is restricted to the 33 operations in the library; how does it behave when presented with images that would benefit from operations outside this set?

- **Weak Direct Comparison with Gemini 2.0 and Limited Exploration of Prompting**: The "Gemini+Library CoT" baseline is crucial for isolating the benefit of puzzle-based fine-tuning, yet it seems underexplored. The paper mentions three-stage prompting with library names and operation categories but doesn't provide the full prompt in the main text (only references supplementary). With the right prompts, sophisticated models like Gemini 2.0 might perform comparably. The paper shows qualitative examples where Gemini produces over-exposed images, but no systematic analysis of why the puzzle-based approach is fundamentally superior to better prompting strategies. This is a critical baseline for justifying the fine-tuning effort.

- **Missing Quantitative Analysis of Reasoning Quality**: While reasoning generation is central to the approach, the paper provides no quantitative evaluation of reasoning quality. Are the <Adjustment, Issue, Solution> triplets accurate? How do humans rate the explanations? Does the quality of reasoning correlate with edit quality? The paper assumes grounding on actual adjustments prevents hallucination, but provides no evidence. A quantitative evaluation of reasoning—e.g., through expert human rating or information overlap with ground-truth adjustments—would strengthen claims about the approach's interpretability. Figure 1 shows an example of good reasoning, but is this representative?

- **Limited Exploration of Alternative Design Choices**: The paper commits to specific choices without thoroughly justifying alternatives. Why three stages rather than two or four? Why Puzzle C's assumption that perturbing expert edits produces worse images? Why fine-tune Qwen-VL-7B rather than larger models like Gemini 2.0 or GPT-4V? The paper mentions using Gemini 2.0 Flash for reasoning generation but doesn't fine-tune Gemini itself—why? The computational cost of 8 hours training suggests a small model was chosen partly for efficiency, but this trade-off is not explicit. Ablations on these design choices would strengthen the work significantly.

- **Evaluation Metrics May Not Fully Capture Perceptual Quality**: While the user study is valuable, some concerns remain. PSNR/SSIM are included but are known to correlate poorly with human perception of image quality—the paper relies more on user studies, which is good but limits reproducibility and comparison with future work. The histogram metric measures distribution matching but not perceptual realism. No perceptual quality metrics (e.g., NIQE, BRISQUE) are reported. The "highest score against any expert" evaluation rule (taking max over 5 Adobe5k experts) may inflate results—averaging across experts might be fairer for methods not specifically trained on their style. The paper should justify this choice and report both variants.

## Research Directions

- **Multi-Expert Adaptive Fine-Tuning with Style Transfer**: Extend MonetGPT to fine-tune on multiple expert editors simultaneously (e.g., all 5 experts in Adobe5k) rather than a single expert, then learn a style adapter that allows the model to dynamically shift between editing styles based on user preference. This could be achieved by: (1) training the base model on multi-expert puzzles with expert labels, (2) introducing lightweight style-specific LoRA adapters, (3) enabling users to specify desired style as input. This would address the current limitation of single-expert bias and enable the model to capture the diversity of professional editing preferences, creating a more generalizable and personalized system. The approach would be highly relevant for practical deployment where different users have different aesthetic preferences.

- **Joint Learning of Operation Parameters and Sampling Strategies**: Investigate whether the model can learn not just parameter values but also which operations to apply (sparse operation selection). Current approach always outputs all parameters in JSON. Develop a variant where the model learns to decide which operations are necessary and which can be skipped, reducing the parameter space further. This could involve: (1) adding a learned gating mechanism to determine operation necessity, (2) training with a sparsity-inducing loss, (3) evaluating whether sparse plans are preferred by users. This research would enable better transfer to images that require fundamentally different editing strategies and reduce unnecessary operations.

- **Hierarchical Planning with User-in-the-Loop Feedback**: Extend the autoregressive editing capability (Figure 9) into a full interactive system where users provide intermediate feedback at each stage, and the model refines subsequent stage planning based on this feedback. Develop a reinforcement learning framework where: (1) user acceptance/rejection of intermediate edits provides reward signals, (2) the model learns to predict user preferences through interaction, (3) the system improves editing plans based on accumulated feedback. This would require collecting user interaction datasets and designing appropriate RL objectives. The result would be a copilot-style system that learns from users during deployment, relevant for both professional and amateur workflows.

- **Cross-Domain Generalization and Automatic Operation Discovery**: Currently, MonetGPT is restricted to 33 predefined operations. Investigate whether the operation-aware learning mechanism generalizes to new domains and image types (e.g., video, medical images) by learning to discover appropriate operations from task-specific image pairs. Approach: (1) provide the model with a library of differentiable operations for the new domain, (2) use the puzzle-based training strategy with domain-specific expert edits, (3) evaluate generalization. This would demonstrate the universality of the puzzle-learning paradigm and enable application to specialized domains like medical image enhancement, scientific visualization, or video retouching where expert guidelines differ substantially from standard photography.

- **Theoretical Analysis of Operation-Awareness and Transfer Learning**: Conduct deeper investigation into why puzzle-based training is effective through: (1) analyzing what representations the model learns (probing studies to identify operation-specific features), (2) studying transfer from puzzles to planning (do improvements in Puzzle A directly predict improvements in editing quality?), (3) measuring semantic similarity between learned operation representations. This could yield theoretical insights into how multimodal models learn about abstract concepts (operations) vs. perceptual features (image appearance), and inform design of better training objectives. Such analysis could influence how we train LLMs for other domains requiring systematic understanding of abstract tools/operations.

- **Evaluation Framework for Explainable Image Editing**: Develop comprehensive benchmarks and evaluation protocols specifically for explainable image editing. Current work uses standard metrics (SSIM, LPIPS) borrowed from unconditional generation, which may not capture explainability quality. Propose metrics that measure: (1) reasoning accuracy (how well do explanations match actual adjustments), (2) reasoning actionability (can users refine suggestions based on explanations), (3) plan coherence (do operations address complementary issues or redundantly target the same aspect). Implement a user study protocol with quantitative rating scales rather than binary preferences. Such a framework would enable fair evaluation of future explainable editing methods and could become a standard benchmark.

- **Few-Shot Adaptation and Rapid Style Customization**: Investigate whether the operation-aware model can rapidly adapt to new expert styles with few examples (e.g., 5-10 edited images). Design a meta-learning approach where: (1) the base model trained on puzzles serves as initialization, (2) fine-tune with just a few expert edits using LoRA or similar efficient adaptation, (3) evaluate whether the adapted model captures the expert's style. This is practically valuable—photographers often have distinctive styles, and rapid customization would enable personalized retouching. The approach would also test the generality of operation-aware representations: if they truly capture fundamental principles of image editing, adaptation should be sample-efficient.

## 主要貢獻

- **針對程序化圖像修飾的操作感知 MLLM**：本文提出 **MonetGPT**，這是首個微調多模態大語言模型 (MLLM) 以理解和規劃程序化圖像修飾操作並進行精確參數估計的框架。與重新生成像素的生成式編輯方法（導致身份丟失）不同，MonetGPT 與精選的 33 個預定義程序化操作庫協作，分三個階段組織（光線、色彩/溫度、特定色彩調整）。這種方法保留了物體身份、分辨率，並通過可解釋的非破壞性編輯提供完整的使用者控制，相容於高分辨率 16 位元圖像。

- **基於視覺謎題的技能學習策略**：本文引入了一種新穎的訓練方法，透過三個特別設計的視覺謎題（而非配對數據的直接監督學習）教導 MLLM 圖像操作感知。謎題 A 教導個別操作效果（給定前後圖像，預測操作和值），謎題 B 教導美學判斷和最優參數範圍，謎題 C 教導綜合編輯計劃生成。此設計解決了 MLLM 對圖像操作本質缺乏理解的根本問題，使其能從有限的專家數據（謎題 A 約 7k 樣本、謎題 B 約 5k、謎題 C 約 13k）學習。

- **推理型基礎數據集合成**：為充分利用謎題型學習，作者透過將預訓練 LLM（Gemini 2.0 Flash）的推理基於實際視覺調整而非允許幻覺來合成推理解釋。對於每個謎題實例，模型生成結構化推理，形式為 <Adjustment, Issue, Solution> 三元組，解釋每個操作如何解決特定視覺問題。此推理既用作訓練信號，也用作推理路徑—在推理期間，MLLM 首先生成關於圖像問題的高級推理，然後使用此推理回歸精確參數值，有效地使用推理作為意圖到數值調整的橋樑。

- **具有使用者互動性的分段程序化流程**：MonetGPT 分三個階段應用編輯（光線 → 色彩調整 → 特定色彩微調），實現多項優勢：(1) 類別內操作的可逆性以可靠地合成訓練數據，(2) 與同時進行多操作規劃相比複雜度降低，(3) 關於哪個操作造成哪種視覺效果的推理更清晰。至關重要的是，MLLM 的自回歸性質使使用者能在任何階段編輯和覆蓋計劃—使用者可修改任何建議的調整，系統會自動重新規劃後續階段操作。

- **與生成式和程序化基線的綜合評估**：本文提供廣泛的評估，比較包括：基於 RL 的方法（Exposure）、生成式方法（MGIE、InstructPix2Pix）、未配對增強方法、直接 MLLM 迴歸變體、Gemini 2.0 與思維鏈、商業軟體（Google Photos）。評估包括定量指標（Adobe5k 上 400 張圖像的 SSIM、LPIPS、PSNR、直方圖交集）、包含新手（n=15）和專家（n=10）評審者的定性使用者研究，以及展示謎題型訓練相對直接迴歸之必要性的消融研究。

- **具有簡化參數空間的實用庫實現**：與使用複雜 GIMP 等工具不同，作者開發了包含 33 個模組化調整操作的 Python 庫，其中每個操作由單個主參數控制（子參數要麼固定要麼衍生）。操作遵循可感知線性 [-100, +100] 標度，使微調 MLLM 能生成直接執行的 JSON 格式編輯計劃，無需額外編碼，使方法對最終使用者實用，同時保持可解釋性。

## 核心洞見

- **未經明確訓練的 MLLM 缺乏操作理解**：本文證明了一個關鍵洞見—儘管預訓練 MLLM 具有強大的視覺理解能力，但它們對圖像操作的作用及其如何影響圖像的內部模型基本上很差。直接在配對修飾數據上微調（「MLLM 迴歸」基線）會大幅失敗，因為模型無法將視覺變化與特定操作聯繫起來。這解釋了為何用操作庫提示 Gemini 2.0 等簡單方法表現不佳的原因。解決方案—透過視覺謎題的訓練，明確教導操作語義—揭示操作感知是一項可學習的技能，可轉移到準確的規劃。

- **推理作為參數迴歸的路徑**：MonetGPT 不是從圖像直接迴歸數值參數（這會在有限數據下引起過度擬合），而是使用思維鏈推理作為中間表示，橋接高級圖像分析到精確參數值。在推理期間，模型首先生成問題和解決方案的語義描述，然後將其轉譯為數值調整。此兩階段過程（推理 → 迴歸）顯著優於直接迴歸基線，表明 LLM 更適合語義推理關於編輯意圖，而非從視覺特徵的數值迴歸。

- **可逆性使大規模合成數據生成成為可能**：透過限制參數類別內的修改保持可逆（例如，僅修改光線操作，然後僅修改色彩操作），作者能程序化從專家編輯圖像生成訓練謎題，無需配對的源目標數據。他們取樣專家編輯圖像 𝐼_X，應用隨機操作擾動以建立降級版本 𝐼_S，然後使用基礎推理生成以標記為何每個操作幫助恢復品質。此未配對方法至關重要—數據集完全從專家編輯合成，訓練期間從未見過原始原始圖像，但泛化到未見過的源圖像。

- **分段規劃降低狀態空間並改善推理品質**：將規劃任務分為三個階段（光線 → 色彩/溫度 → 特定色彩），而非聯合預測所有操作，大幅簡化問題。圖 7 展示直接迴歸在不同輸入條件下產生幾乎相同的參數值，而分段 MonetGPT 產生適當變化的調整。此分段使關於哪些操作解決哪些視覺問題的因果推理更清晰—人類無法輕易解釋為何需要 15 個同時操作，但可清楚闡述在特定光線情景下為何黑色需提升、高光需降低。

- **操作感知轉移到多樣化美學偏好**：圖 7（右面板）顯示同一操作感知 MLLM 可根據風格標籤（「復古」、「平衡」、「充滿活力」）僅透過不同的提示條件生成不同的編輯計劃。此靈活性對於固定參數迴歸不可能實現。基礎操作理解允許模型根據風格意圖調整其調整，表明教導機器關於操作語義的知識比教導特定編輯模式可解鎖更大的適應性。

- **身份保留和可解釋性與使用者偏好一致**：使用者研究顯示對 MonetGPT 的強烈偏好（相對 Exposure 或 MGIE，60-70% 的新手和專家使用者偏好），此偏好與身份保留和可解釋性相關。專家欣賞調整的可解釋性，可建議小的改進如「增加膚色飽和度」，表明他們理解且可覆蓋系統。相比之下，可能保留或改善指標的生成式方法由於身份丟失仍可能失敗使用者偏好，突顯程序化方法儘管 PSNR 值略低但更好地服務專業工作流程。

- **定量性能**：MonetGPT 在大多數指標上達到具競爭力或領先的性能—SSIM 與 GooglePhotos 並列（0.90），可比較的 LPIPS（0.07 對 0.06），在 PSNR（23.75）上超過大多數開源基線。直方圖指標（79.50）表明良好的分佈匹配，儘管略低於 GooglePhotos（86.47）和 Unpaired（83.98）。在 LPIPS 上，MonetGPT（0.07）匹配最佳表現者（RSFNet 0.08、MGIE 0.08），同時使用可解釋的程序化方法而非端到端生成。

- **使用者偏好在各專業水準間一致**：在面對面比較中，MonetGPT 對 Exposure 和 MGIE 基線的偏好率分別約 65-70% 的新手和專家使用者。圖 8 明確展示跨使用者群體的一致偏好，專家提供建設性反饋（例如「增加膚色飽和度」、「更好的曲線強調」），表明他們理解並信任提議的調整。此偏好差距值得注意，因為它與純粹基於指標的排名相矛盾—具有更高 PSNR（GooglePhotos 25.86 對 MonetGPT 23.75）的方法在使用者研究中並非一致偏好。

- **消融：直接迴歸性能嚴重不足**：MLLM 迴歸基線（相同模型、架構、訓練數據但訓練為直接預測參數）在 SSIM 0.84、LPIPS 0.10、PSNR 20.89 上達成—在 SSIM（0.90）和 PSNR 上遠低於 MonetGPT。圖 10 顯示迴歸基線遭受嚴重過度擬合：它在 100 張不同圖像上預測幾乎相同的參數值，無法捕捉完整的調整範圍。相比之下，MonetGPT 的提琴圖展示它適當地使用完整的參數範圍 [-100, +100]，確認基於推理的規劃實現更大的多樣性和適應性。

- **計算效率權衡**：完整分段管道推理在 RTX 4090 上需約 25 秒，相比約 10 秒用於直接迴歸和約 2 秒用於 Exposure。儘管比基於 RL 的方法慢，此對後處理工作流程可接受。訓練在 H100 GPU 上需約 8 小時用於謎題型微調對比 2.5 小時用於迴歸，代表 3.2 倍增加。此成本由於相對替代方案在泛化和身份保留上的顯著改進而正當。

- **對不同領域圖像的泛化**：僅在 PPR10K（主要為肖像）上訓練但在多樣化 Adobe5k 圖像上評估顯示合理泛化。直方圖交集指標（79.50）表明預測分佈儘管領域轉移仍大致與專家目標匹配。然而，相同評估設置上與 GooglePhotos 的比較表明改進空間—GooglePhotos 可能利用 MonetGPT 明確避免依賴的大型專有訓練數據集。

## 優勢

- **新穎且良好動機的問題表述**：本文解決了生成式編輯（丟失身份）和傳統程序化編輯（難以規劃）之間的真實差距。將程序化圖像修飾作為 MLLM 推理任務的框架表述是新穎的，MLLM 缺乏操作理解的觀察是有洞見的且有充分證據支持。該方法植根於人類學習理論（透過謎題解題的技能學習），為設計選擇增加了可信度。該問題對專業工作流程具有明確的實踐價值，其中可編輯性和可解釋性是不可商量的。

- **透過視覺謎題的創新訓練策略**：三謎題框架是創意且精心設計的。與其強制模型從有限配對數據學習，作者巧妙地將學習分解為語義單位：理解個別操作（謎題 A）、美學判斷（謎題 B）和規劃（謎題 C）。進程在教學上合理，使用基礎推理生成以防止幻覺在技術上複雜。此方法可推廣到其他需要操作理解的領域，並可能影響未來多模態模型技能學習的工作。

- **綜合性實驗評估**：本文比較跨越不同基線的多樣方法，包括基於 RL（Exposure）、神經迴歸（RSFNet）、生成式（MGIE、InstructPix2Pix）和商業解決方案（GooglePhotos）。評估包括多個維度：定量指標（SSIM、LPIPS、PSNR、直方圖）、包含專家和新手的使用者研究、展示謎題型訓練必要性的消融，以及含專家反饋的定性分析。補充材料似乎廣泛（多次參考）。共 25 位評審者的使用者研究對此領域而言規模合理。

- **實用實現和可重現性**：作者承諾發佈代碼、數據、模型和補充結果。本文提供充足的實現細節：Qwen-VL-7B 用 DoRA 適配器微調、特定超參數（學習率 1e-4、秩 256、單輪次）、數據集大小（7k、5k、13k 樣本）和庫規範（33 操作）。選擇開發簡化 Python 庫而非依賴 GIMP 顯示對實踐部署的關注。基於 JSON 的輸出格式使整合直接。

- **可解釋性和使用者控制**：與黑盒生成式方法不同，MonetGPT 為每個調整提供人類可讀的推理並啟用分段編輯。圖 9 展示自回歸編輯，其中使用者可在任何階段修改提議的計劃，且系統重新規劃後續操作—這是重要的可用性優勢。<Adjustment, Issue, Solution> 結構化推理格式可解釋且可行動，使領域專家能驗證和細化建議。

- **經過仔細考慮的設計選擇及明確合理化**：分段管道設計（第 4.3 節）由三項考慮合理化：可逆性用於數據合成、複雜度降低、更清晰的推理。Qwen-VL 對潛在更大模型的選擇、參數量化至 [-100, +100] 以便於標記化，以及推理數據集的結構都顯示慎重考慮。本文解釋不僅 WHAT 他們做了什麼，也解釋 WHY，這有助於可重現性和未來工作。

## 劣勢

- **有限的訓練數據多樣性和潛在領域轉移**：模型僅在 PPR10K 專家 A 上用約 25k 合成謎題樣本訓練，然後在 Adobe5k 上評估。PPR10K 主要為肖像圖像，而 Adobe5k 包含更多樣化的場景。儘管本文聲稱泛化，定量結果揭示差距：直方圖交集（79.50）明顯低於 GooglePhotos（86.47）和多個基線。本文未提供跨領域消融（例如，在兩個 PPR10K 專家上訓練、在 PPR10K 保留上評估）以隔離領域轉移的影響對比方法本身。GooglePhotos 的強大性能建議更大、更多樣的訓練數據可能至關重要，但此限制未被深入分析。

- **謎題生成不清楚及潛在數據洩露**：本文指出謎題被「合成地」生成，透過對專家圖像應用隨機操作，但關鍵細節缺失。操作參數如何取樣？分佈是什麼？對於謎題 B，本文假設「對 𝐼_X 進行任何充分大的調整會降低圖像品質」—此為未驗證的強假設。謎題 B 中四個擾動級別如何選擇？是否有原則分佈，或是臨時性的？測試圖像來自不同數據集（Adobe5k 對 PPR10K），但透過從專家圖像生成的合成謎題的潛在數據洩露未被討論。若 Adobe5k 用於生成謎題，結果會虛高。

- **失敗案例和限制的分析不足**：本文展示主要成功例子，但對何時及為何方法失敗的討論有限。圖 6 展示定性比較，但未突顯失敗模式。MonetGPT 與哪些類型圖像對抗？本文提及專家建議「小的改進」，但未量化何時需要這些或它們有多重要。推理時間（25 秒）對 Exposure（2 秒）實質上慢—對於專業工作流程，這可接受嗎？本文未討論此權衡。此外，方法限制於庫中 33 個操作；當呈現會受益於此集外操作的圖像時，它如何表現？

- **與 Gemini 2.0 的弱直接比較及有限提示探索**：「Gemini+Library CoT」基線對於隔離謎題型微調的益處至關重要，但似乎探索不足。本文提及三階段提示含庫名和操作類別，但未在主文本中提供完整提示（僅參考補充）。具有正確的提示，Gemini 2.0 等複雜模型可能表現可比。本文展示定性例子其中 Gemini 產生過度曝光圖像，但無系統分析為何謎題型方法基本上優於更好提示策略。此為隔離基線，對於證實微調努力至關重要。

- **缺失推理品質的定量分析**：儘管推理生成對方法至關重要，本文未提供推理品質的定量評估。<Adjustment, Issue, Solution> 三元組準確嗎？人類如何評審解釋？推理品質是否與編輯品質相關？本文假設基於實際調整的基礎防止幻覺，但未提供證據。推理的定量評估—例如透過專家人類評級或與地面實況調整的信息重疊—會加強關於方法可解釋性的聲稱。圖 1 展示良好推理的例子，但此是否代表性？

- **有限的替代設計選擇探索**：本文承諾特定選擇，未徹底合理化替代方案。為何三個階段而非兩個或四個？為何謎題 C 的假設，擾亂專家編輯產生較差圖像？為何微調 Qwen-VL-7B 而非較大模型如 Gemini 2.0 或 GPT-4V？本文提及使用 Gemini 2.0 Flash 用於推理生成，但未微調 Gemini 本身—為何？8 小時訓練的計算成本建議小型模型在部分程度上出於效率考慮被選擇，但此權衡不明確。這些設計選擇的消融會顯著加強工作。

- **評估指標可能未完全捕捉感知品質**：儘管使用者研究有價值，某些關切仍存在。PSNR/SSIM 已納入但已知與人類感知圖像品質相關性差—本文更依賴使用者研究，這是好的但限制了可重現性和與未來工作的比較。直方圖指標測量分佈匹配但非感知真實性。未報告感知品質指標（例如 NIQE、BRISQUE）。「對任何專家的最高分」評估規則（取 5 位 Adobe5k 專家的最大值）可能虛高結果—跨專家平均對非專門針對他們風格訓練的方法可能更公平。本文應合理化此選擇並報告兩個變體。

## 研究方向

- **多專家自適應微調與風格轉移**：擴展 MonetGPT 以在多個專家編輯者上同時微調（例如，Adobe5k 中所有 5 位專家），而非單個專家，然後學習允許模型根據使用者偏好動態轉移編輯風格的風格適配器。此可透過以下達成：(1) 在含專家標籤的多專家謎題上訓練基礎模型，(2) 引入輕量級風格特定 LoRA 適配器，(3) 使用戶能指定所需風格作為輸入。這將解決當前單專家偏見的限制，並使模型能捕捉專業編輯偏好的多樣性，建立更可泛化和個性化的系統。此方法對於實踐部署高度相關，其中不同使用者具有不同的美學偏好。

- **操作參數和採樣策略的聯合學習**：調查模型是否能學習不僅參數值，也學習應用哪些操作（稀疏操作選擇）。當前方法總是在 JSON 中輸出所有參數。開發一個變體，其中模型學習決定哪些操作必要，哪些可略過，進一步降低參數空間。這可涉及：(1) 添加學習的閘機制以確定操作必要性，(2) 用稀疏誘導損失訓練，(3) 評估使用者是否更偏好稀疏計劃。此研究使模型能轉移到需要基本不同編輯策略的圖像，並減少不必要的操作。

- **具有使用者在迴路反饋的分層規劃**：將自回歸編輯能力（圖 9）擴展到完整的互動系統，其中使用者在每個階段提供中間反饋，模型基於此反饋細化後續階段規劃。開發強化學習框架，其中：(1) 使用者接受/拒絕中間編輯提供獎勵信號，(2) 模型透過互動學習預測使用者偏好，(3) 系統根據累積反饋改進編輯計劃。此將需要收集使用者互動數據集，設計適當的 RL 目標。結果將是一個助手式系統，在部署期間從使用者學習，與專業和業餘工作流程相關。

- **跨領域泛化和自動操作發現**：當前 MonetGPT 限於 33 個預定義操作。調查操作感知學習機制是否泛化到新領域和圖像類型（例如，視頻、醫療圖像），透過學習從任務特定圖像對發現適當操作。方法：(1) 為新領域提供模型含差分操作的庫，(2) 用領域特定專家編輯使用謎題型訓練策略，(3) 評估泛化。此將展示謎題學習典範的通用性，並使應用於專業領域如醫療圖像增強、科學可視化或視頻修飾成為可能，其中專家指南與標準攝影大幅不同。

- **操作感知和轉移學習的理論分析**：透過以下方式進行對為何謎題型訓練有效的深入調查：(1) 分析模型學習的表示（探測研究以識別操作特定特徵），(2) 研究謎題到規劃的轉移（謎題 A 中的改進是否直接預測編輯品質改進？），(3) 測量學習操作表示的語義相似性。此可產生關於多模態模型如何學習抽象概念（操作）對比感知特徵（圖像外觀）的理論洞見，並通知設計更好訓練目標。此分析可影響我們如何為需要系統理解抽象工具/操作的其他領域訓練 LLM。

- **可解釋圖像編輯的評估框架**：為可解釋圖像編輯開發綜合基準和評估協議。當前工作使用標準指標（SSIM、LPIPS），借自無條件生成，可能未捕捉可解釋性品質。提議測量以下的指標：(1) 推理準確性（解釋如何匹配實際調整），(2) 推理可行性（使用者能否基於解釋細化建議），(3) 計劃相干性（操作是否解決互補問題或冗餘針對同一方面）。實施含量化評級尺度而非二進制偏好的使用者研究協議。此框架將啟用對未來可解釋編輯方法的公平評估，可成為標準基準。

- **小樣本適應和快速風格自訂**：調查操作感知模型是否能用幾個例子（例如，5-10 編輯圖像）快速適應新專家風格。設計元學習方法，其中：(1) 在謎題上訓練的基礎模型用作初始化，(2) 用少數專家編輯進行微調，使用 LoRA 或類似效率適應，(3) 評估自適應模型是否捕捉專家風格。此在實踐上有價值—攝影師通常具有獨特風格，快速自訂將使個性化修飾成為可能。此方法還將測試操作感知表示的通用性：若其確實捕捉圖像編輯的基本原理，適應應為樣本高效。
